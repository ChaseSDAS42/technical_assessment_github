# Welcome!
## This repo will show you how to become an honorary member of the annex, and will help you practice Git along the way.
### Complete all of the steps below from the command line unless specified otherwise.

#### Step 1:
  * Email/Slack Logan with your GitHub username to be added as a contributor on this repo.

#### Step 2:
  * Clone this repo using SSH.
    * __**hint:**__ _checkout Session 7 of the Udemy training course_

#### Step 3:
  * Create a personal branch (yourname) and switch to it. 
    * You will merge this personal branch to _master_ later on.
  
#### Step 4:
  * Create a text file in your branch called "(yourname)_two_truths_one_lie.txt" and populate it accordingly.
  * Commit these changes to your local personal branch.

#### Step 5:
  * Push your local personal branch upstream to the remote repo.
    * __**hint:**__ _If you try to use_ `git push` _you will get an error because your personal branch doesn't exist in the reomte repo yet. Use the suggested_ `--set-upstream origin` _operator in addition to the_ `git push` _function to create an upstream origin branch to push to._

#### Step 6:
  * Hop over to GitHub in your web browser of choice. 
  * Go through a few peoples' personal branches and comment your guesses for their "two_truths_one_lie" file **on the commit** that added the file to their branch.
  * Head back to your terminal when you are done.

#### Step 7:
  * Switch to your local master branch and pull from the remote master branch to make sure that everything is up to date.

#### Step 8
  * Merge your local master branch with your local personal branch.
    * This will add your unique "two_truths_one_lie" file to the local master branch

#### Step 9:
  * While still on the local master branch, edit the "jokes.md" file by adding your name as a title and a joke as plain text below it.
  * Commit these changes with a commit message that includes your name.
  
#### Step 10:
  * From here, ensure that your local master branch contains your unique "two_truths_on_lie" file and the "jokes.md" file with your joke in it.
  * Push your local master branch to the remote repo.

#### Step 11:
  * Hop back over to GitHub to visually verify that your unique "two_truths_one_lie" file has been added to the master branch, and that your joke is present in the master "jokes.md" file. 

#### Step 12:
  * Message Logan once you've completed these steps.

#### Step 13:
  * Await King Curtis's approval of your joke (minimum of two chuckles required) and eagerly await your letter of acceptance into the annex.
