# Welcome! This repo will show you how to become an honorary member of the annex, and will help you practice Git along the way.
### Complete the steps below independently once you have finished the GitHub Ultimate course on Udemy. All of the steps should be completed from the command line unless specified otherwise. Feel free to reach out to Logan with any questions you might have.

#### Step 1:
  * Fork this repo in GitHub.
    * _***hint:***_ Checkout the top left of the page.

#### Step 2:
  * Open your CLI of choice _(iTerm2, Terminal, etc.)_
  * In your **Desktop** directory, create a new directory called "Git Knowledge Check" and move into it.
      * _**hint:**_ `mkdir` `cd`
      
#### Step 3:
  * Hop back over to GitHub in your web browser.
  * Next, clone your forked copy of this repo using SSH and move into it.
    * _**hint:**_ Review _[Session 7](https://das42.udemy.com/github-ultimate/learn/lecture/4731854#content)_ of the Udemy training course.

#### Step 4:
  * Create a new personal branch, calling it your first name, and switch to it
  
#### Step 5:
  * Create a text file in your branch called `YOURNAME_two_truths_one_lie.txt` and populate it accordingly.
  * Stage this file and commit these changes to your newly created personal branch.
    * Be sure to include a commit message.

#### Step 6:
  * Push your local personal branch upstream to your remote repo.
    * _**hint:**_ If you try to accomplish this using `git push` alone, you will get an error. This is because your personal branch doesn't exist in the reomte repo yet. To remedy this, you will need to initialize an upstream origin for your person branch. Review _[Lecture 94](https://das42.udemy.com/github-ultimate/learn/lecture/4732118#overview)_ of the Udemy training course if you need a refresher on how to do this.
  * Check that your branch is up to date using `git status`.

#### Step 7:
  * Hop over to GitHub in your web browser and create a pull request between your forked personal branch and the 

# Still Editing


#### Step 8
  * Merge your local master branch with your local personal branch.
    * This will add your unique _two_truths_one_lie_ file to the local master branch

#### Step 9:
  * While still on the local master branch, edit the _jokes.md_ file by adding your name as a title and a joke as plain text below it.
  * Commit these changes with a commit message that includes your name.
  
#### Step 10:
  * From here, ensure that your local master branch contains your unique _two_truths_on_lie_ file and the _jokes.md_ file with your joke in it.
  * Push your local master branch to the remote repo.

#### Step 11:
  * Hop back over to GitHub to visually verify that your unique _two_truths_one_lie_ file has been added to the master branch, and that your joke is present in the master _jokes.md_ file. 

#### Step 12:
  * Message Logan once you've completed these steps.

#### Step 13:
  * Await King Curtis's approval of your joke (minimum of two chuckles required) and eagerly await your letter of acceptance into the annex.
